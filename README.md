# MY GODOT LAB
Bunch of experiment codes I created while playing with [Godot Game Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/)

This could also be a proof-of-concepts.

Each modules were a separate "game", and is standalone. In a case where any of these module(s) need the functions of the other module(s), instead of try referring to that module(s), we will instead make a new one over at the module(s) that need those functions. In other words, there's no such thing as reusable code for a different modules.
